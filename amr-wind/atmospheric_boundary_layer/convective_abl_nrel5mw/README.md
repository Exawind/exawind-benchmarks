# Convectively unstable ABL for wind turbine simulations

This ABL inflow is used for the [actuator line NREL5MW](../../actuator_line/NREL5MW_ALM_BD/) and geometry resolved NREL5MW benchmark cases

The conditions are sumarized below:
- Hub-height wind speed: 11.4 m/s
- Hub-height wind direction: 240 degrees SW

## Simulation Setup
