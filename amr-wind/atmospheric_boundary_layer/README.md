## Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL)

These AMR-Wind benchmark cases feature three convective stability states: neutral, stable, and unstable.
Each case is performed with a uniform mesh resolution, and the three cases adhere to examples from the
following three publications, respectively:

Publication of these AMR-Wind results is currently under review.
