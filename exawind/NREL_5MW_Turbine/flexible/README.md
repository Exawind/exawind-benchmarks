# NREL 5MW Rotor in Atmospheric Boundary Layer With OpenFAST/BeamDyn Fluid Structure Interaction
This benchmark contains a geometry and boundary-layer resolved model of the NREL 5MW reference turbine [1] in a developed near-neutral convective atmospheric boundary layer with a mean hub-height streamwise velocity of 11.4m/s.

- Hub-height: 90m
- Blade Radius: 63m
- Rated Power: 5 MW
- Type: Upwind 3 Blade
- Simulation dt: 0.003443526170799 s
- OpenFAST dt: 0.0008608815426997245 s

*Note on run-time: Current results are for approximately 180s simulation time, but a minimum of 300s will be posted as results become available.*

*Note on turbine controller: This case will be re-run in Q3 as a result of a small bug in the controller. If interested in running this benchmark, please contact the authors for up-to-date scheduling*

## Freestream Conditions
A near-neutral convective boundary layer precursor was run to feed the domain for this case. Full details are posted here: [Convective ABL for NREL5MW](../../../amr-wind/atmospheric_boundary_layer/convective_abl_nrel5mw/README.md)

10 minute flow statistics:
- Hub-height streamwise velocity: 11.4 m/s
- Hub-height flow direction: ~240.0 degrees

**Total number of cells: 155,363,046**

The near-body (Nalu-Wind) mesh was created using a proprietary surface mesher, pyHyp, and Pointwise. Three blades are split at the hub, and an unconnected tower is included.
- Hexahedral cells
- Cell count: 13,436,646

Off-body (AMR-Wind) mesh was generated using the built-in capability of AMR-Wind. Off-body mesh information is summarized below 
- Mesh topology: structured hex with nested refinements
- Domain in x= 0 to 5000m, y=0m to 5000m, z=0m to 1000m
- Initial grid size: 10m
- Finest cell size: 0.625m with 4 AMR levels
- Cell count: 141,926,400

### Processor Decomposition: 
- Nalu-Wind: 672 ranks
- AMR-Wind: 4928 ranks

### Timings:
- Mean wall-clock time per timestep for entire simulation: 17.75s 
- Mean wall-clock time per timestep per cell 1.142e-07s

## Quick Exawind Simulation Guide
#### Step 0: Run the ABL precursor in AMR-Wind
This simulation is driven by an ABL precursor, run in AMR-Wind, with recorded boundary planes, initial conditions, and average temperature.
#### Step 1: Develop and decompose overset mesh
It is necessary to develop a near-body mesh surrounding the blade surface in Nalu-Wind using external tools. This
mesh should be in the Exodus II format and decomposed to approximately 20K cells per core available to Nalu-Wind.
#### Step 2: Run the OpenFAST precursor for 5760 OpenFAST timesteps (approximately 1 rotation)
``srun -n1 openfastcpp inp.yaml``
#### Step 3: Run the full Exawind suite
``srun -N 50 -n 5600 exawind --nwind 672 --awind 4928 nrel5mw.yaml &> log``
#### Step 4: Setup and Run the full Exawind suite restart(s)
``srun -N 50 -n 5600 exawind --nwind 672 --awind 4928 nrel5mw_r1.yaml &> log_1``
